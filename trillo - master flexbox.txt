flexbox: an overview of the philosophy behind flexbox (very important)

flexbox
    - is a new module in css3 that makes it easy to align elements to one another, in different directions and orders 
    - the main idea behind flexbox is to give the container the ability to expand and to shrink elements to best 
      use all the available space 
    - flexbox replaces float layouts, using less and more readable and logical code 
    - flexbox completely changes the way that we build one dimensional layouts 
    - a true revolution in css 

main flexbox concepts 
    - parent container: flex container 
    - children: flex items 
    - display: 'flex-inline' - behaves like inline block element 
    - direction children are layed out are the main axis 
        > other direction is cross axis 

flexbox properties overview 
    - container 
        > flex-direction (row - default, row-reverse, column, column-reverse)
        > flex-wrap (nowrap - default, wrap, wrap-reverse)
        > justify-content (flex-start - default, center, space-between, space-around, space-evenly)
            - defines the position of the items on the main axis 
        > align-items (stretch - default, flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline)
            - defines the position of the items on the cross axis
        > align-content (stretch - default, flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around)
            - only applies when there is more than one row
            - defines how rows are aligned on the cross axis if there is empty space
    
    - item 
        > align-self (auto - default, stretch, flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline)
            - similar to align-items for one item 
            - can change alignment of one item 
        > order (0 - default, integer)
            - order one specific item will be ordered in the container 
            - helpful for reordering items 
        > flex-grow (0 - default, integer)
            - how much an item can grow
        > flex-shrink (1 - default, integer)
            - how much an item can shrink
        > flex-basis (auto - default, length)
            - base width
        > flex: (flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis)
                (integer, integer, length)

flex items order starts at 0
    - to bring it to front add negative number (-1)

flex-shrink: 0 - doesn't allow element to shrink on resize
