basic principles of responsive design and layout types


basic responsive design principles 

1. fluid grids and layouts
    to allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browser the website 
    uses % rather than px for all layout related lengths 

2. flexible/responsive images 
    images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt nicely to the current viewport 

3. media queries 
    to change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create different versions of our 
    website for different widths
