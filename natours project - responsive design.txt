mobile first vs desktop first and break points

responsive design strategies

desktop first 
    - start writing css for the desktop: large screens 
    - then media quieries shrink design to smaller screens 
    - more traditional 
    - easier to learn
    - media queries to test for max-width

mobile first 
    - start writing css for mobile devices: small screens
    - then media queries expand design to a large desktop screen 
    - forces us to reduce websites and apps to the absolute essentials 
    - tests for min-width

max-width and min-width
    - desktop first 
        > initial desktop-first code goes in the larger range (~1200px)
        > if screen has max width of 600px or smaller, use this design 
            - maximum width at which media query still applies 
        > if two media queries are true, code in both queries will apply 
            - the bottom most media query will take precedents 
            - the order of code is important
    - mobile first 
        > initial mobile-first code goes into smaller range (~0-600px)
        > if screen has a min width of 600px or larger, use this design 
            - minimum width at which media query still applies 

mobile first pros/cons
    - pros 
        > 100% optimised for the mobile experience 
        > reduces websites and apps to the absolute essentials 
        > results in smaller, faster and more efficient products 
        > prioritizes content over aesthetic design, which may be desirable
    - cons 
        > the desktop version might feel overly empty and simplistic 
        > more difficult and counterintuitive to develop 
        > less creative freedom, making it more difficult to create distinctive products 
        > clients are used to see a desktop version of the site as a prototype 
        > do your users even use the mobile internet? what's the purpose of your website? 

selecting our breakpoins: the options 
    - bad 
        > using the width of popular devices
        > optimizing for one specific device, ignoring users of other devices 
        > not future proof
    - good (will be using this way for natours)
        > look at common devices and group them then create media queries around the groups 
            - ie. mobile phones, tablets height / width, laptops 
    - perfect
        > ignore devices all together and only look at your content and design 
        > start at one width and increase/decrease width, once design breaks insert a new breakpoint
        > this approach can be difficult 
        > without contraints of a few predefined breakpoints it's hard to find the best ones 
    
selecting our breakpoints: the good approach 

breakpoints for:
    - phones 
    - portrait tablets 
    - landscape tablets 
    - desktop

jonas's breakpoints 
    - phone (max 600px)
    - tablet portrait (900px)
    - tablet landscape (1200px)
    - desktop (1800px)
    - big desktop (1800px+)
