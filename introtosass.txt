what is sass?

sass is a css preprocessor, an extension of css that adds power and elegence to the basic language 

sass source code -> sass compiler -> compiled css code

main sass features 
    - variables: for reusable values such as colors, font-sizes, spacing, etc 
    - nesting: to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code 
    - operators: for mathematical operations right inside of css 
    - partials and imports: to write css in different files and importing them all into one single file 
    - mixins: to write reusable pieces of css code 
    - functions: similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can than be used 
    - extends: to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them 
    - control directions: for writing complex code using condtionals and loops

&:first-child - replaces navigation path; writes out selector; used with pseudo classes

for example:
    - .navigation li:first-child is same as &:first-child
